    ### CPSC 120

    *Lab 6

        Lab 6, part 2 because I already knew how blackjack worked. I was very interested on how
        the code would work to count the value of the cards. Writing the functions to count the
        points was chellenging but overall I thought it was pretty cool once it worked.

    *Lab 1
       
        Lab 1, part 1 was my first experience ever coding something. I was still confused on how
        everything really worked but I wanted to learn. When I was able to the message to display
        on my terminal, it was a good feeling of acomplishment. Overall it was a fun introduction.

    *Lab 4
       
        Lab 4, part 2, the hilo game, was another favorite because it was like a game of sorts. 
        I played around with it myself during my freetime even after submitting my assignment.
        I like seeing the code actually work and give me the correct output depending if the number
        guessed was high or low.
